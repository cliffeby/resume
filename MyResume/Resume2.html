            sectors.</p>

        <p>In 2012, Mr. Eby was named president of the America’s Transportation operating company, with responsibility
            for managing a business unit $1 billion in annual revenue and 4,000 employees located in 70
            offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. On a national basis, he is responsible for all planning, design,

            transportation and infrastructure projects across the Americas. He was previously senior vice president in
            charge of Parsons Brinckerhoff’s Technical Excellence Centers and supported the firm’s strategic efforts in
            the rail and infrastructure markets, particularly high-speed rail./p>

        <p>From 1973 to 1980 and then again from 1985 through 2004, he was with an international transportation and
            construction management firm where he held several executive management positions covering such areas as
            finance, business development, operations, strategic planning and technology.</p>

        <p> Mr. Eby served as acting administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) from 2008 to 2009 and as
            deputy administrator from 2005 to 2008. He was responsible for the FRA’s day-to-day administrative functions
            and rail financial assistance programs and also served as the agency’s representative to the boards of the
            Moynihan Station Redevelopment Corporation, the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation, the USDOT Credit
            Council and Amtrak.</p>

        <p>Earlier in his career, Mr. Eby was director of finance and statistics for the Association of American
            Railroads (AAR) and, as a young engineer, he worked on the $2 billion Northeast Corridor Improvement Program
