        <h4> Key Qualifications</h4>
        Clifford Eby offers specific expertise in rail safety, finance and economic regulatory practices,
        transportation policy, and rail infrastructure program design. His perspective is as diverse as his
        experience; he has held executive and engineering positions and has worked in both the public and private
        sectors.

        In 2012, Mr. Eby was named president of the America’s Transportation operating company, with responsibility
        for managing a business unit with close to $1 billion in annual revenue and 4,000 employees located in 70
        offices throughout the U.S. On a national basis, he is responsible for all planning, design, strategic
        consulting and construction services within the Americas transportation market, including highways, bridges,
        transit and rail, aviation, and ports and marine. In this role, he has management oversight for over 2,700
        transportation and infrastructure projects across the Americas. He was previously senior vice president in
        charge of Parsons Brinckerhoff’s Technical Excellence Centers and supported the firm’s strategic efforts in
        the rail and infrastructure markets, particularly high-speed rail. Prior to this position, he served as East
        Group Manager-Transportation, with responsibility for sales, marketing and operations of four of seven
        regions across the U.S. and Canada.

        From 1973 to 1980 and then again from 1985 through 2004, he was with an international transportation and
        construction management firm where he held several executive management positions covering such areas as
        finance, business development, operations, strategic planning and technology.

        Mr. Eby served as acting administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) from 2008 to 2009 and as
        deputy administrator from 2005 to 2008. He was responsible for the FRA’s day-to-day administrative functions
        and rail financial assistance programs and also served as the agency’s representative to the boards of the
        Moynihan Station Redevelopment Corporation, the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation, the USDOT Credit
        Council and Amtrak.

        Earlier in his career, Mr. Eby was director of finance and statistics for the Association of American
        Railroads (AAR) and, as a young engineer, he worked on the $2 billion Northeast Corridor Improvement Program
        and on design sections of the Washington, DC Metro.
